# Second Project
 ## Topics of my Second **Deep-Learning** course project:
In this project I have implemented a `Segnet Network` in order to perform the `Image Classification` task on `UTKFace` dataset:
    1. In **Part A** a **segnet** architecture has been implemented; however, the training scheme and hyperparameters are not the same as the reference papaer: In contrast to the reference paper, I have trained the whole network at once (instead of training different pairs of encoder-decoder in seperate steps). Moreover I have utilized two optimizer, `SGD` and `Adam`, to train the net and to compare the results. As mentioned in a paper, a smart person can figure out that **Adam** has a higher convergance rate than **SGD** optimzer, which results in a better performance in lower iterations. The codes and results are provided in [Deep_HW2_Segnet_Adam][https://github.com/ARokni/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Project%202/PartA/Deep_Hw2_000215_PartA_Res_Final2_1635_SGD(3).ipynb](**Segnet** with **Adam optimizer**) and in [Deep_HW2_Segnet_SGD][https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_lIpVqAC-IXXJSWKkHV1CzQYTtiOGBJb] (Segnet with **SGD** optimizer).
